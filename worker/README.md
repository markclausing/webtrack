# The score board

Deployed at **https://webtrack.vibecoach.workers.dev**, which is the address in
`src/config.js`. It answers `GET /highscores` and `POST /highscores`, holds one
Durable Object, posts new times to Discord, and has an admin key set for taking
rows off again.

Two commands and the board is shared:

```sh
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler deploy          # from this directory
```

Wrangler prints an address like `https://webtrack.your-name.workers.dev`. Put it
in `src/config.js` as `DEFAULT_BOARD` and every copy of the page posts its board
there and reads everybody else's back.

Nothing else is needed. There is no multiplayer in this game, so there is no
relay to run and no sockets to keep alive: the Worker answers two calls, `GET
/highscores` and `POST /highscores`, and holds one Durable Object.

## Trying it without deploying

`npm start` in the repository root serves the game *and* the same two calls from
`server/board.js`, keeping the board in `highscores.json`. The browser cannot
tell the difference. Use `?board=` in the address to point a page at any other
one:

```
http://localhost:8080/?board=https://webtrack.your-name.workers.dev
```

## Announcing new times

```sh
npx wrangler secret put DISCORD_WEBHOOK
```

Paste a Discord webhook URL. Every time that actually lands in a top ten is
posted; a run that missed the board, or one arriving for the second time from a
second device, is not. The same channel can take all five games - the message
says which one it came from.

It is a secret and it is treated as one: it lives in `wrangler secret`, never in
this repository, and anybody holding the URL can post into that channel as this
game. What it says is checked by `npm run test:board`, which runs the wording
through every case without a network anywhere near it - which is what
`announce.js` was held apart from the Worker for in the first place.

## The broom

A public list with no accounts on it collects something you would rather it did
not, sooner or later.

```sh
npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_KEY

# one row, by id, and it stays off even though the browser that set it still has it
curl -X POST -H "x-admin-key: KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"ids":["m8x1a-9qz"]}' https://webtrack.your-name.workers.dev/highscores/remove

# or all of them
curl -X POST -H "x-admin-key: KEY" https://webtrack.your-name.workers.dev/highscores/reset
```

With no `ADMIN_KEY` set, both doors return 404 - which is the right default for
anybody who deploys this and never reads this file. This deployment has one, and
a copy is in `worker/.admin-key`, which `.gitignore` has covered since before
there was a key to put in it.

## What it will and will not accept

Every row that arrives goes through the same `cleanEntry` the browser runs. A
time under ten seconds or over an hour is not a run anybody rode and does not
survive it, names are three characters of `A-Z 0-9 -`, and a board of more than
64KB is refused outright. That is the whole of the validation, and it is
deliberately not more: this is a score board for friends, not an anti-cheat
system, and anybody determined to put a fake time on it can.
