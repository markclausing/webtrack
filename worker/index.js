/**
 * The score board, as a Cloudflare Worker.
 *
 * This is the only server the game has. The other four in this family also run a
 * relay, because they have two people in a room to keep together; this one has
 * nobody to introduce to anybody - there is no multiplayer here and there is not
 * going to be - so all that is left is the board, and the board is one Durable
 * Object with one key in it.
 *
 * It speaks exactly what server/board.js speaks, so the browser cannot tell
 * which one it is talking to and neither can the tests.
 *
 * See README.md next door for the two commands that put it live.
